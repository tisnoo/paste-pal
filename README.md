Paste-pal is a synchronised Clipboard between devices. Ideal for sharing sharing content between device clipboards, without needing to download an external messaging service.

To get started, simply create a room on a device 1, and join using the room code on device 2. Happy sharing!

## Getting started

Once you've cloned this project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start development server:

```sh
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Note
- Seems to work pretty wonky on Firefox, please test on Google Chromse
